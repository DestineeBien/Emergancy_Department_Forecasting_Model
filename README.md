# Emergancy_Department_Forecasting_Model
Overview
This project focuses on forecasting daily paediatric emergency department (ED) attendances for an NHS Acute Trust. The goal is to provide accurate predictions to assist with staffing decisions over a 28-day period. The analysis involves time series forecasting, model selection, evaluation, and implementation using Python 3 in a Jupyter Notebook.

Key Objectives
âœ” Time Series Exploration: Analysing trends and patterns in historical ED attendance data.
âœ” Forecasting Model Selection: Comparing different models against a naÃ¯ve benchmark.
âœ” Model Evaluation: Assessing accuracy using appropriate statistical metrics.
âœ” Forecasting Implementation: Delivering a 28-day forecast for operational planning.
âœ” Reproducible Analysis: Ensuring results can be replicated with provided Python code.

Technical Components
Dataset: paediatrics_train.csv, containing daily paediatric ED attendances from 2014-2017.
Forecasting Techniques: Time series models such as ARIMA, Exponential Smoothing, Prophet, or LSTM.
Performance Metrics: Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE), and Mean Absolute Percentage Error (MAPE).
Python Implementation: Code follows PEP8 coding standards and is structured for clarity.
Submission Requirements
ðŸ“Œ Jupyter Notebook (.ipynb) with a structured lab report and runnable Python code.
ðŸ“Œ Charts & Visualisations for trend analysis and forecast validation.
ðŸ“Œ Forecast Accuracy Assessment for model comparison.
ðŸ“Œ Backup Copy (.zip) containing all necessary files.

Assessment Criteria
âœ… Forecasting Process & Model Evaluation
âœ… Lab Report Quality (Executive Summary, Methods, Results, Discussion)
âœ… Study Recommendations for NHS Staffing
âœ… Code Quality & Reproducibility
